# pslab

Personal PowerShell lab for small, focused scripts and experiments. This repo currently contains a camera-media organizer script plus test data/log folders.

## Repository layout

- `scripts/` PowerShell scripts
- `data/` sample inputs/outputs for local testing
- `logs/` CSV plans and summaries generated by scripts

## Running scripts from VS Code (PowerShell terminal)

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Open the integrated terminal and select the PowerShell profile.
3. Run the script from the repo root.

Example (dry-run, safe by default):

```powershell
.\scripts\Organize-SamsungCamera.ps1 -SourceCameraPath .\data\in -ArchiveRoot .\data\out -KeepMonths 6
```

Apply changes (copy):

```powershell
.\scripts\Organize-SamsungCamera.ps1 -SourceCameraPath .\data\in -ArchiveRoot .\data\out -KeepMonths 6 -Apply
```

Apply changes (move):

```powershell
.\scripts\Organize-SamsungCamera.ps1 -SourceCameraPath .\data\in -ArchiveRoot .\data\out -KeepMonths 6 -Move -Apply
```

Notes:
- Default mode is dry-run; nothing is copied or moved unless `-Apply` is set.
- The script writes plan/summary CSVs into `logs/`.
